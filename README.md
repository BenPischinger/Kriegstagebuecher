# War Diaries WWII
 
This is a VR Project developed for the HTC Vive using the Unreal Engine 4 by me and two artists.

It was created for an interactive museum exhibition where people were supposed to experience scenes from a diary that was written by a german soldier during the second world war.

In this scene the soldiers were retreating from Volgograd and had to halt due to a blocked road. The player exits the truck and can then explore the scene, play around with VR elements and interact with the soldiers. After a while the convoy is attacked by german aircrafts, at which point the player has to cover one of the trucks with a nazi flag to signal that they are also german.

We had originally planned to work on this project for multiple semesters and add voice acting to the NPCs through which information about the second world war could be conveyed to the player. Alas, the exhibition was cancelled and the project had to be shelved before we got to that point. 

# Video Demonstration

Due to the ongoing pandemic I was unable to access my University's Vive, so I had to capture footage in the editor.
